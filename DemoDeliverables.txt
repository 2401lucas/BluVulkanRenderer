GOALS IN ORDER:
Multi-thread (Secondary Command Buffers for ImGui) (Secondary command buffers working, multi threading would be trivial but would probably slow down performance with the thread pool overhead being not worth the saving the small workload in command buffer recording)
GPU Particles/Compute Pipeline
-Particle System Holder (Self contained, taking parameters) -Draw commands & buffer recording
More Detailed Lighting + settings + sponza
Returning to Asset Loading:
-Preloading all assets at runtime is the way.
-Dynamically Creating Pipelines is also the way
-Need some sort of caching and preferably one pipeline per mesh, not one per material
