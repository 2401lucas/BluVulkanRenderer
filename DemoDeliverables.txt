List of Goals:
Scene loading (sponza)
More Detailed Lighting + settings
-Dynamic Light Settings -> Hierarchy for selecting & disabling lights
[Reference BluEngine for pipeline create, so long as everything is preloaded] Returning to Asset Loading:
-Preloading all assets at runtime is the way.
-Dynamically Creating Pipelines is also the way
-Need some sort of caching and preferably one pipeline per mesh, not one per material
Reflection Probes -> Required for generating Irradiance maps different area's of the environment. They are selected by proximity
Rewrite shader

Environment Map->Reflection Texture (Generated from Reflection Probes)
BRDF Map->Roughness/Dot(Light Dir, Normal) Lookup table for -> output(0.1) Scale & Bias
Irradiance map->Diffuse lighting of environment (Generated from Environment Map)

TBD/Needs more Research/Not Worth implementing
Multi-thread (Secondary Command Buffers for ImGui) (Secondary command buffers working, multi threading would be trivial but would probably slow down performance with the thread pool overhead being not worth the saving the small workload in command buffer recording)

GPU Particles/Compute Pipeline
-Particle System Holder (Self contained, taking parameters) -Draw commands & buffer recording


AO (Baked Texture)
GTAO? HBAO? (PBR SSAO)(Dynamic Calculation)
GOOD LIGHTING!!!!! (Meaning: Supporting different light types with PBR)
GOD RAYS
Hardware Path Tracing
REIMPLEMENT INTO ENGINE!!!
Animations
Shadow Generation - Baking Shadows?
SMAA

Challenges
Compute Buffers allign with Double/Triple Buffering(Async) (Currently to test, Dispatch the ComputeShader and updaet once they are done)
Shader Cache

Next build(~5 days) will have:
Fixed Lighting
Better UI(Currently doesn't capture Keyboard or scrollwheel input)
More Settings in the UI
GPU based Particle System
AA Settings & new AA implementation

Future features include:
Scene loading(Sponza)
Deferred Rendering
Reflection Probes 
Realtime Ambient Occlusion(GTAO or HBAO)
Shadows
