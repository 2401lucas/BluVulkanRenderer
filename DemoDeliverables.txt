GOALS IN ORDER:
Multi-thread (Secondary Command Buffers for ImGui) (Secondary command buffers working, multi threading would be trivial but would probably slow down performance with the thread pool overhead being not worth the saving the small workload in command buffer recording)
GPU Particles/Compute Pipeline
-Particle System Holder (Self contained, taking parameters) -Draw commands & buffer recording
More Detailed Lighting + settings + sponza
AO
SSAO
GOOD LIGHTING!!!!!
GOD RAYS
DYNAMIC LIGHTING
REIMPLEMENT INTO ENGINE!!!

Challenges
Compute Buffers allign with Double/Triple Buffering
