### Books
The majority of books I read about Graphics Programming ended up just being tutorials, showing the code and explaining what the code does instead of explaining the overall archetechture or the reasons for what they are programming. The best resource, and my most use resource by far was the Khronos documentation of vulkan. It is extremely detailed and contains all of the required information I needed with a complete explanation of the API.
